## Summary
All-night build session. Started ~00:15, rebranded at 10:08.

## What We Built
- **Mull** — "Think deeper" - AI thinking companion
- Repo: github.com/starksama/mull
- Stack: Next.js 16, Tailwind 4, Framer Motion, Zustand, Lucide icons

## Key Features
1. URL parsing with Readability.js
2. Clean reader view with progress tracking
3. Text selection → chat bubble UI with AI
4. Pure highlighting (without triggering AI)
5. Branch navigation (up/down = explored paragraphs)
6. Follow-up questions at article end
7. "Finish" button → session summary + export
8. Light/dark/sepia themes + font size control
9. Demo mode with mock articles

## Rebrand (10:08)
- AI Reader → **Mull**
- Tagline: "Think deeper"
- Button: "Mull" instead of "Read"
- "Mull it over" footer

## UX Expansion (10:00)
Anton's vision:
- Chat-like interface (not just reader)
- Two entry points: URL paste OR ask anything
- Follow-up questions at article end
- "Finish" → summarize all notes
- Multiple AI agents with different purposes
