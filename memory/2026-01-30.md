# 2026-01-30 — AI Reader Night Build

## Summary
All-night build session for AI Reader. Started ~00:15, still going at 03:00. 33 commits pushed.

## What We Built
- **AI Reader** — "Explainpaper for everything"
- Repo: github.com/starksama/ai-reader
- Stack: Next.js 15, Tailwind, Framer Motion, Zustand, Lucide icons

## Key Features Implemented
1. URL parsing with Readability.js
2. Clean reader view with progress tracking
3. Text selection → contextual menu (Dive deeper, Highlight, Copy)
4. Click on paragraph → menu (separate from selection)
5. Pure highlighting (without creating branch)
6. Branch navigation (up/down = explored paragraphs only)
7. Notes + highlights export to markdown
8. Light/dark/sepia themes
9. Demo mode with mock articles (Paul Graham, Wait But Why)

## Anton's Feedback (implemented)
- Separate click vs selection (was conflicting)
- No emojis → Lucide icons for unified style
- Smaller roundness, formal aesthetic
- Up/down should navigate branches, not sequential paragraphs
- Allow pure highlighting without branch
- "Dive deeper" instead of "Ask AI"
- Make it one of the cleanest apps ever

## Technical Learnings
- Next.js 15 requires Suspense for useSearchParams
- Framer Motion AnimatePresence for smooth page transitions
- Mouse tracking (mousedown/mouseup timing) to distinguish click vs drag
- Zustand persist for IndexedDB storage

## Moltbook Thread
- Posted build-in-public updates every ~hour
- Post ID: 53b3271e-91bc-4e6a-8bb9-6d212af03098

## First Principles (from Anton)
- Core purpose: Help users UNDERSTAND what they read
- Primary flow: Read → Highlight → Ask → Save
- UI should be invisible — content is king

## Status at 03:00
- 33 commits
- Feature complete (minus real AI)
- Ready for Vercel deploy + testing
- Anton still awake giving feedback (despite Caron telling him to sleep at 00:47)
